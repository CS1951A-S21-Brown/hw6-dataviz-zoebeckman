    <h3>Written Questions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The first question addressed on the top left is “how many titles per genre are there on Netflix?” 
            I displayed this using a barograph, which is able to represent different genres on a common axis (count of movies). 
            Because the overall number of genres is quite large, I added a toggle button so that the visualization would be 
            less cluttered that allows for visualization of the number of titles per genre by movie genres, tv genres, and
             overall top 20 genres. The second question addressed on the bottom left is “what is the average runtime of movies
              by release year?” I chose to use a scatterplot with lines to track the average runtime over time. Each data point 
              represent the average runtime of movies released that year, and a tooltip can be used to see the exact year and 
              average runtime values. The third question is addressed on the right side of the page which looks into actors who 
              acted in the same movies. I thought a network flow graph with nodes representing actors as well as links representing 
              movies both actors acted in would be the best way of representing this. I filtered down the data for this to just 2019 
              and using non-international movies. There is still a fair number of data points so I added a tooltip that appears when 
              hovering over a node to display the actor at that node.
        </li>
        <li>D3 was helpful in creating interesting color combinations as it allows for color gradients and designation of color through 
            other functions. D3 also made it fairly manageable at creating a network graph that would be much harder to create on other 
            platforms that was necessary for visualizing links between actors. D3 was also helpful being able to integrate different data file types 
            (.csv and .json), whereas other frameworks or programs require their data to be of certain types or formats. </li>
        <li>D3 is not the best tool for creating a visualization because all locations for parts of graph like bars or circles are determined 
            by functions, including those for axes and titles, while other frameworks like matplotlib do most of this work for you. D3 is not 
            the best tool for creating a visualization because it requires knowledge of Javascript and html that not everyone knows. D3 is also 
            not the best tool for creating a visualization because it makes switching between types of charts very difficult, so if one 
            wanted to experiment with the best way of displaying data, one would have to tediously create many graphs. </li>
        <li>My dashboard is about medium level accessibility. I don’t use many demarcations in color, which means color-blind users won’t be 
            missing out on information, but more changes in color or textures to denote different nodes or bars could be useful to cleanly separate 
            data points. As mentioned in the medium article, this dashboard is less accessible to users with adhd and epilepsy as there is an animation 
            in the nodes that would be better controlled by the user, but currently runs at each page reload. As mentioned in the betterment article, 
            one large downfall of this dashboard is that it uses tool tips, which the articles states is not helpful because it sometimes cannot be seen 
            by assistive technology. The bar graph is instead a good example of having some of the data displayed alongside the bars, without using hover overlays. </li>
        <li>When adding color to my graphs, I wanted to add more colors so that different nodes could be differentiated, or add changes to the node size to indicate 
            the number of connections and the link thickness to indicate the number of shared movies. I wasn’t entirely sure how to do this in D3 although I saw it in
             the example, which was my main barrier. Another implementation idea was to label each node with the actor name but with so many nodes I instead chose to
              use hover tool tips so the graph would not be so cluttered. I think that in data preprocessing I also could have filtered down the node data more so so 
              that the graph is less cluttered and thus more accessible to all users.</li>
